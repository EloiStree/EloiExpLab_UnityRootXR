# Eloi Exp Lab Unity Root XR

> The Unity Code of Eloi Exp lab without native content to be fork.

My goal is to make a sample game call Eloi 'Exprimentation Lab' that explore the world of XR.
But as every platform have it native code, this version is a neutral zone without native code.

The project must be fork for each headsets: 
- Android XR
  - Quest 1 2 3
  - Lynx R1
  - Pico *
- Computer
   - Steam VR
   - Oculus Lab
   - Window Mixed Reality *
 - UWP
   - Hololens 2 *

_( * I am not targeting those platform. But maybe one day.)_
       
I could use branches. But I like forking to be sure of not mixing code at one point.  

ðŸš¨ Note: I have no idea of what I am doing ^^, don't take my project as an example.  
I am just trying to make my code usable in several platform but have project that allows to explore more specitic and native sample of them all seperately.  
Hope me the best. Feel free to contact me if you know better way to do it.  

ðŸš¨ I must stay in the same Unity version until I can't do it anymore. (Unity 2022.3.10f1)
